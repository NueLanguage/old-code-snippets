# Old Code Snippets for Nue

> Ancient theoretical code snippets before the language was even properly made.

This repository includes a bunch of files which have been polluting the main repository for a while in the `old` directory. They have since been moved here.

The code contained in this repository represents what the language was at the very early stages, right before proper development even began - this was all theoretical whilst [I](https://richy.lol) was still basically doing PL theory for Nue.

Code here is very much guaranteed not to be compatible with any version of Nue, not even the first version when it releases. But if you *do* find a piece of code that still works today, please genuinely join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VHDnSxgkGa) to let me know - it would be interesting to see which concepts have remained the same ever since the idea of Nue even came up in my head.
